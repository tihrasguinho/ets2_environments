<h3 class="heading-title">Prologue</h3>
The SCS Extractor has been introduced years ago, widely used by most modders
to extend the functionality and gameplay experiences on both SCS popular games
Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator. Even though it's handy
and useful, SCS Extractor has a big disadvantage: lack ability of selective
file extraction. Came from that limitation, the SXC Extractor was written.
<br /><br />
SXC Extractor (can be pronounced as Sexy Extractor) is another level compared
to the predecessor. It has list mode, able to selectively extract or list
contents based on certain criteria, and also support extracting mod zipped
files even with the "encrypted" ones. SXC Extractor however does not provide
ability to compress or recompress. As its name says it just an extractor tool.

<h1 class="heading-chapter">Basic Usage</h1>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="about" />
<h3 class="heading-title">About the Program</h3>
SXC Extractor is a console program runs under Microsoft Windows. Like the
predecessor, it is a simple text based application. No fancy GUI and no
<i>bullsh*t</i>. It comes without installer. Extract the SXC Extractor package using
any ZIP Archiver program onto a destination folder of your choice. From
Windows Explorer, press <span class="inline_file">Shift + Right Click</span> on the extracted destination
folder then choose a menu item labeled as "Open Command Prompt from here" or
"Open Power Shell from here" depending on your Windows version. Running SXC
Extractor can be done by typing:

<div class="code">sxc</div>

Or under Power Shell console:

<div class="code"><span class="inline_white">.\</span>sxc<span class="inline_white">.exe</span></div>

After typing, press the Enter key on the keyboard to actually execute the
application. Running extractor without any parameter will just display a usage
tips of parameter description, which will have described more details here.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="workfiles" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Working with Files</h3>
SXC Extractor requires at least one parameter in order to function. You need
an input file to be processed, either SCS native game data/DLC files (with
<span class="inline_file">.scs</span> extension) or mod zipped files (with <span class="inline_file">.scs</span> or <span class="inline_file">.zip</span> extension). It can be
typing like this:

<div class="code">sxc <span class="inline_white">thefile.scs</span></div>

Or:

<div class="code">.\sxc.exe <span class="inline_white">thefile.zip</span></div>

Note the argument is preceding with a space character. Each argument must be
separated with at least one space character. If an argument contains spaces,
you should enclose it with double-quotes. Take a look at this example for
input file that containing long path and spaces:

<div class="code">sxc <span class="inline_white">"</span>C:\Program files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\def.scs<span class="inline_white">"</span></div>

Typing long argument can be a painful task especially if you don't know how
to copy a fully qualified path with file name and pasting it into Windows
console. SXC Extractor allow you to select a file in an easy way through Open
File dialog. Use an <span class="inline_sym">-i</span> switch (lowercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">I</span>') as replacement of input
file into the argument as follow:

<div class="code">sxc <span class="inline_white">-i</span></div>

It will bring you a popup dialog window to select a file. Pressing Cancel
button on the dialog will abort the operation, and display usage tips as if
you run the program without argument.
<br /><br />
Another trick is by creating a Windows shortcut and store it in the same
folder of SXC Extractor. For example, if you create a shortcut that
pointing to actual "<span class="inline_file">base.scs</span>" file on Steam folder with the shortcut file name
it as "<span class="inline_file">base.scs</span>" and store it in SXC Extractor folder, you can supply this
shortcut as the input file argument:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs</div>

Or:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs<span class="inline_white">.lnk</span></div>

When working with SCS native game data/DLC input file, SXC Extractor will
create an associate index file (with <span class="inline_file">.idx</span> extension) and store it at the same
folder where SXC Extractor stored. The index file will be created when opening
input file at the first time, or re-created when the input file gets update.
Index file is required in the purpose of speed up process to work with the
same input file later. Note that there'll be no index file being generated
when working with mod zipped file.
<br /><br />
By default, all index files (<span class="inline_file">*.idx</span>) always stored and accessed from the same
folder where SXC Extractor located. Starting from version 1.19.10.15, you can
specify different folder location to store and access all index files by
putting the <span class="inline_sym">-Li</span> switch (uppercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">l</span>' and lowercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">I</span>') then
followed by the designated path.
<br /><br />
For example:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs <span class="inline_white">-Li</span> "C:\sxc\index files"</div>

This will causing the tool to generate or load all those index files located
on "<span class="inline_file">C:\sxc\index files</span>" folder. Make sure the folder path you specify does
exists, otherwise SXC Extractor will revert back by looking them onto the
default location (which is the tool's folder itself).
<br /><br />
Using the <span class="inline_sym">-Li</span> switch has a little disadvantage because you have to declare it
each time running the tool's commands. For semi-permanent solution, you can
define the path through Windows console environment variable. From the above
example, type this command on Windows console:

<div class="code">set <span class="inline_white">SXC_IDX_PATH</span>=C:\sxc\index files</div>

There is not necessary to enclose the path with double-quotes when defining
through environment variable. By defining it once, you can launch the tool
multiple times without having to put the <span class="inline_sym">-Li</span> switch every time.
<br /><br />
As mentioned before, defining the path through environment variable is a
"semi-permanent" solution because it will gone when you close the console
window. Make it as permanent is highly not recommended unless you know what
you're doing. Also it is advisable to always specify full qualified path and
stay away from using relative path to prevent problems later.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="listextract" />
<h3 class="heading-title">List Mode &amp; Extraction</h3>
If supplying with only input file, SXC Extractor works under list mode. List
mode is where you are able to see the list of items (files and folder paths)
within the input file without actually extracting them. By default, only files
with their own path are listed. To extract these items, you have to supply the
output path argument as target extraction folder.
<br /><br />
Output path argument must be pointing to an existing folder with write access
permission. Avoid supplying path to system folders as they might have special
access permission that may not granted to Windows user currently logged in.
Output path is specified by an <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> switch (lowercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">O</span>') followed by
the target folder path like this:

<div class="code">sxc myfile.scs <span class="inline_white">-o</span> C:\Temp</div>

If the target folder path containing spaces, as usual you must enclose it with
double-quotes, like this:

<div class="code">sxc myfile.scs -o <span class="inline_white">"</span>C:\My projects\ets2 mod<span class="inline_white">"</span></div>

<div class="note">
In older version of SXC Extractor, any files stored in output folder specified
with <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> switch will be overwriten. Starting with version 1.19.11.30, any
existing file will be preserved. This is allow you to extract additional
files into your project folder without accidentally overwrite the existing
working files. If you want to overwrite the existing files anyway (like the old
behavior ones), use <span class="inline_sym">-ov</span> instead of <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> switch.
SXC Extractor version 1.22.9.10 also introduce additional extract modes described in
advanced topic: <a href="#extractmodes">Extract Modes</a>.</div>

SXC Extractor allow you to select target folder path by selecting it from a
folder selection dialog. Instead of using an <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> switch, replace it with an <span class="inline_sym">-od</span>
switch like this:

<div class="code">sxc myfile.scs <span class="inline_white">-od</span></div>

On execution, it will ask for target folder location through a dialog window.
Pressing the Cancel button on the dialog will abort target folder path
selection and automatically fallback into the list mode.

<div class="note">For security reason, SXC Extractor does not natively support
folder shortcut or logical folder like a ZIP file.</div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="basewild" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Base Path &amp; Wildcard Filtering</h3>
The main feature of SXC Extractor is the ability to list or extract selective
files. This is done through the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> and <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switches (lowercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">D</span>' and
'<span class="inline_sym">F</span>' respectively). The <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch is used to specify the base path as working
root path. Any items on input file where outside this path will be ignored and
excluded from the process. Specify this base path as second argument after the
<span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch, as shown in this example:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs <span class="inline_white">-d</span> unit/hookup/</div>

This will list all items under "<span class="inline_file">unit/hookup/</span>" path on the "<span class="inline_file">base.scs</span>" input
file.
<br /><br />
Just take a look at another example:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -o C:\Temp <span class="inline_white">-d</span> \def\world</div>

This will extract all files under "<span class="inline_file">def\world\</span>" path in input file "<span class="inline_file">def.scs</span>"
and store those files into "<span class="inline_file">C:\Temp</span>" folder. Even though you specify a base
path, the results of extracted files still maintain the original directory
structures. From the above example, those files (and subfolders if any) can be
found in "<span class="inline_file">C:\Temp\def\world</span>" folder. It works that way to allow modders
working with their mods and keep directory structures in place. Note that you
can specify slash or backslash character as delimiter in the base path, with
or without leading and trailing path delimiter.
<br /><br />
The <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch allow you to filter items in input file based on '<span class="inline_sym">*</span>' (asterisk)
and '<span class="inline_sym">?</span>' (question mark) pattern characters. The text pattern follows after the
switch. Asterisk character means "anything else" while the question mark means
"any one character". These pattern characters can be placed anywhere, single
or multiple times. For example, a pattern "<span class="inline_file">*side</span>" will match any text trailing
with "side", so these text will match:

<div class="quote">from the in<span class="inline_lgreen">side</span><br />
beyond the out<span class="inline_lgreen">side</span></div>

but these text won't:

<div class="quote">for the in<span class="inline_lred">side</span>r<br />
both the <span class="inline_lred">side</span>ways</div>

A pattern "<span class="inline_file">the*</span>" will match any text leading with "the", so these text will
match:

<div class="quote"><span class="inline_lgreen">the</span> brown fox<br />
<span class="inline_lgreen">the</span>re'll be only one</div>

but these text won't:

<div class="quote">o<span class="inline_lred">the</span>r than him<br />
mo<span class="inline_lred">the</span>r nature</div>

A pattern "<span class="inline_file">*ing*</span>" will match any text contains "ing", so all these text will
match:

<div class="quote"><span class="inline_lgreen">ing</span>redients of soup<br />
made for anyth<span class="inline_lgreen">ing</span><br />
the <span class="inline_lgreen">ing</span>enious winglets</div>

A pattern "<span class="inline_file">*mo*th*</span>" will match any text contains "mo" followed any text
contains "th", so these text will match:

<div class="quote"><span class="inline_lgreen">mo</span>n<span class="inline_lgreen">th</span>ly income<br />
up to his <span class="inline_lgreen">moth</span>er</div>

The pattern with question mark will find any matches fit into single
character. For example, a pattern "<span class="inline_file">ab?de</span>" would match a word like "abcde",
"ab1de", "ab de", etc. A pattern "<span class="inline_file">some?????</span>" will match word "something",
somewhere", or "somewhat." (notice the trailing period character). You may
combine both asterisks and question marks on the pattern. For example, a
pattern "<span class="inline_file">*h??self</span>" will match "himself" or "ask to herself".
<br /><br />
If you need to only filter entries under the working path defined in <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch,
ignore all sub-entries beneath, you can define <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch without supplying any path delimiter.
<br /><br />
Have a look in this example:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs <span class="inline_white">-d</span> def <span class="inline_white">-f</span> *</div>

It will filter any file under the "<span class="inline_file">def\</span>" folder only, skip any existing sub-entries in it.
<br /><br />
Let's have a look another example:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs <span class="inline_white">-d</span> def <span class="inline_white">-f</span> *_data.sii</div>

It will filter any "<span class="inline_file">.sii</span>" file with file names terminated with "<span class="inline_file">_data</span>"
inside the current working folder "<span class="inline_file">def\</span>" only.
<br /><br />
Another example:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs <span class="inline_white">-f</span> * -ld<br />
sxc def.scs <span class="inline_white">-d</span> / <span class="inline_white">-f</span> * -ld</div>

Both are identical operation, will filter any folder names under root path only.
<br /><br />
With a combination of the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch, you can&mdash;however, put a leading path delimiter into the
<span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch to apply recursive filter operation under the path defined in the
<span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch, like this:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d def -f <span class="inline_white">/</span>*<br />
sxc def.scs -d def/world -f <span class="inline_white">/</span>*</div>

Although it isn't practical because you can use the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch alone, and it quite faster than
using wildcards in the <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch. The above lines are simply should replaced with these commands:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d def<br />
sxc def.scs -d def/world</div>

The <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch if used alone without the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch will find any matches
pattern to the entire entry names. If the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch supplied, matches pattern affect only to all
entries under the base working path specified in <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch. Let's have a look for few usage examples of
<span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch as follows:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -f unit/hookup/*</div>

This will list all entries under "<span class="inline_file">unit/hookup/</span>" path. The usage actually has
similar result when using the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch like this:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -d unit/hookup/</div>

The difference is the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch is much faster than the <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch. Consider
this when working and filtering with lots of entries.
<br /><br />
Let's have a look another example. This will try to find any file and path
containing word "<span class="inline_file">adviser</span>" and display matching results as the list of files.

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -f *adviser*</div>

This will extract any files containing "<span class="inline_file">adviser</span>" under path "<span class="inline_file">ui/</span>" and store
the extracted files into "<span class="inline_file">C:\Temp</span>" folder. Actually this is will extract
all Route Advisor layout definition files.

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -f *adviser* -d ui -o C:\Temp</div>

Starting with SXC Extractor version 1.23.2.14, you can also "<i>negate</i>" the filter
condition by prepend it's pattern with a <span class="inline_sym">!</span> (asterisk) symbol,
which is similar to logical <b>NOT</b> operation. This mean you want to filter all
entries <b>EXCEPT</b> the ones meet filtering condition in the pattern. For example:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def -f <span class="inline_gold">!</span>*_data.sii</div>

This operation will list all "<span class="inline_file">.sii</span>" file entries under "<span class="inline_file">def/</span>" folder, <b>EXCEPT</b>
files ended with "<span class="inline_file">_data</span>" in their name.
<br /><br />
Besides of using wildcards in the <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch, you can also use regular expression. The usage of filtering and
searching with regular expression is described more details in advanced topic: <a href="#regexfilter">Regular Expression Filtering</a>.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="advancedfilter" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Advanced Filtering</h3>
SXC Extractor support multiple set of filtering criteria. This is allow you
to perform multiple filtering in a single pass. Just create a pure text file
containing several filtering criteria, where each line represent one set of
both base path and wildcard filtering. This example defines three filtering
criteria to filter only items related to Route Advisor:

<div class="quote-code">material/ui/adviser<br />
sound/ui/adviser/&amp;&amp;*adviser*<br />
ui/&amp;&amp;adviser*</div>

Each line may define either base path, wildcard filtering, or both. Base path
and wildcard filtering are separated by two ampersand characters (<span class="inline_sym">&amp;&amp;</span>). If you
define only wildcard filtering, prepend ampersands separator before wildcard
pattern like this:

<div class="quote-code"><span class="inline_lgreen">&amp;&amp;</span>*adviser*</div>

To let them easy to read, you can put spaces or tabs between ampersands
separator. The above example can be defined like this:

<div class="quote-code">material/ui/adviser<br />
sound/ui/adviser/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="inline_lgreen">&amp;&amp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*adviser*<br />
ui/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="inline_lgreen">&amp;&amp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adviser*</div>

<div class="note">Starting SXC Extractor version 1.23.2.14, you can prepend the
wildcard filtering with a <span class="inline_sym">!</span> (asterisk) symbol to
"negate" the condition.</div>

Save these filtering definitions as a text file and put the text file name
prepend with an '<span class="inline_sym">@</span>' (at) character after the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch. For example:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -d <span class="inline_white">@</span>adviser_filter.txt -o C:\Temp</div>

If you save the multiple filtering definition file with a name containing
spaces, don't forget to enclose it with double-quotes:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -d <span class="inline_white">"</span>@C:\My Filters\Adviser Definition.txt<span class="inline_white">"</span> -o C:\Temp</div>

Please note when you define advanced filtering this way, the <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch will
be ignored. Advanced filtering may be handy when you working with a mod that
contains asset's complexity involving many files.

<div class="note">For security reason, SXC Extractor will reject filtering
definition file which is larger than 512 Kb in size, containing non-standard
ASCII text. In short, it accept only pure 7-bit ASCII text file with size less
than or equal 524,288 bytes.</div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="outputsuppress" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Output Suppression</h3>
By default, SXC Extractor will be displaying all messages and errors. You can
hide unnecessary messages by supplying the <span class="inline_sym">-q</span> switch (lowercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">Q</span>').
To hide error messages as well, use <span class="inline_sym">-qe</span> switch instead. Message suppression
will be handy when launching SXC Extractor through a batch script, interfacing
with third-party application, or redirecting output to other device. The
following example will be saving all list of files in "<span class="inline_file">base.scs</span>" into a text
file called "<span class="inline_file">list_base.txt</span>":

<div class="code">sxc base.scs <span class="inline_white">-qe</span> &gt; list_base.txt</div>

During <b>List Mode</b>, you can also suppress output entries by specify the <span class="inline_sym">-lq</span> switch.
No match entries will be displayed, otherwise it will display the progress in percentage.
The usage of this switch under <b>List Mode</b> is not really useful, unless you want to keep
the output always tidy and clean during batch process.
<br /><br />
Starting with SXC Extractor version 1.22.12.2, the usage of the <span class="inline_sym">-lq</span> switch can also be used
during <b>Extract Mode</b>. It will suppress unnecessary output and only display entries that
actually extracted&mdash;or in the usage of the <span class="inline_sym">-oT</span> switch will
only displaying entries currently different. Take a look at the example below
to compare the difference.
<br /><br />
Without the <span class="inline_sym">-lq</span> switch:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world -f *.sign* -oK C:\extract</div>

Output:

<div class="quote-code">=== skip matching: /def/world/sign.base_vehicle.sii<br />
=== skip matching: /def/world/sign.custom.sii<br />
extract: /def/world/sign.sii<br />
=== skip matching: /def/world/sign_board_model.sii</br />
extract: /def/world/sign_stand.sii</div>

With the <span class="inline_sym">-lq</span> switch:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world -f *.sign* <span class="inline_white">-lq</span> -oK C:\extract</div>

Output:

<div class="quote-code">extract: /def/world/sign.sii<br />
extract: /def/world/sign_stand.sii</div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="listpause" />
<h3 class="heading-title">List Mode &amp; Page Pausing</h3>
When displaying files under List Mode, it will scroll to the last line. If
working with lots of items, you can use <span class="inline_sym">-p</span> switch to allow a pause message
appears every 24 lines (default). For example:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs <span class="inline_white">-p</span></div>

To allow pause message appears every n lines, use <span class="inline_sym">-p:n</span> switch. This example
will show pause message every 50 lines:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -p<span class="inline_white">:50</span></div>

It is accepting minimum 3 lines and maximum 99 lines. Please note the <span class="inline_sym">-p</span>
switch doesn't affect when working with message suppression through <span class="inline_sym">-q</span> or
<span class="inline_sym">-qe</span> switch.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="listdisplay" />
<h3 class="heading-title">List Mode Display</h3>
SXC Extractor by default will list files under List Mode. This behavior is
similar to when supplying the <span class="inline_sym">-l1</span> switch (lowercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">L</span>') into the
argument. To list both files and path, you can use the <span class="inline_sym">-la</span> or <span class="inline_sym">-l0</span> switch. The <span class="inline_sym">-ld</span>
or <span class="inline_sym">-l2</span> switch is used to display only paths. This switch mainly intended in the
purpose of interfacing with third-party application.

<div class="note">Please note SXC Extractor does not provide ability to
"<i>extract</i>" paths only. Extract operation always applies to files.</div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="forcemode" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Force Mode</h3>
This function only applies to SCS game data/DLC file format. You must supply
the <span class="inline_sym">-X</span> switch (uppercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">x</span>') in order this mode to works. It will list
or extract all files stored in input file into a single level folder hierarchy.
This mode will be useful when working with game data/DLC files that has no
root directory or their directory structures has been stripped off. Please
note since there is no directory information, the path and file names are
unknown. All files being listed or extracted will be named to their associated
hash code followed by the <span class="inline_file">.DAT</span> extension. For example:

<div class="code">sxc core.scs -o C:\Temp <span class="inline_white">-X</span></div>

<div class="note">Please note when working with Force Mode, the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> (base path),
<span class="inline_sym">-f</span> (wildcard filter), and <span class="inline_sym">-l</span> (list display) switches are ignored since they
are no longer relevant under this mode.</div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="quitprompt" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Quit Prompt Message</h3>
When working with batch script or running through a shortcut, you may consider
to put a confirmation message before SXC Extractor quit and closing console
window. This can be done by putting the <span class="inline_sym">-c</span> switch (lowercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">C</span>') into
the argument. This let SXC Extractor showing a confirmation message asking to
press a key before quit. You can specify a countdown delay with <span class="inline_sym">-c:n</span> switch to
allow application quit by itself after n seconds. For example, this will
prompt user to press a key and quit automatically after 10 seconds:

<div class="code">sxc -c<span class="inline_white">:10</span></div>

The countdown delays are ranged from 3 to 60 seconds.

<div class="note">Please note the <span class="inline_sym">-c</span> switch doesn't affect when working with
message suppression through <span class="inline_sym">-q</span> or <span class="inline_sym">-qe</span> switch.</div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h1 class="heading-chapter">Extended Usage</h1>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="extractmodes" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Extract Modes</h3>
There are additional switches to activate "extract mode" and define a target extract folder,
besides of the default <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> and <span class="inline_sym">-od</span> switches already described in <a href="#listextract">List Mode &amp; Extraction</a> topic.
These additional switches, along with their particular purpose, will be explained here in details.
<br /><br />
In SXC Extractor prior version 1.19.11.30, the usage of <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> switch will always overwrite
existing files if present. Later versions, the <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> switch will skip an extracted file
if one already exists in the target extract folder. In order to allow existing files to be overwriten, the <span class="inline_sym">-ov</span> switch
should be used instead. This example will overwrite existing files, if any, in target extract folder:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world <span class="inline_white">-ov</span> C:\extract</div>

Starting with SXC Extractor version 1.22.9.10, additional switches also available. The <span class="inline_sym">-oc</span> switch
will create the target extract folder if one currently does not exists. If target folder
does exists, the extraction continue as the same behavior of <span class="inline_sym">-ov</span> switch:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world <span class="inline_white">-oc</span> C:\extract</div>

The <span class="inline_sym">-oC</span> switch (uppercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">c</span>') has opposite existing file behavior compared to the <span class="inline_sym">-oc</span>
switch. It will create the target extract folder if one currently does not exists. If target folder
does exists, existing files in it will <b class="inline_lred">NOT</b> overwriten, the extraction continue as the same behavior of <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> switch:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world <span class="inline_white">-oC</span> C:\extract</div>

To perform update to the existing files in target folder, you should use the <span class="inline_sym">-ot</span> switch. A file
will be extracted <b class="inline_lred">only and only if</b> the same file name exists in the target folder and both
files are differ (update operation). If both files match or that file does not exists in target
folder, extraction will be skipped:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world <span class="inline_white">-ot</span> C:\extract</div>

Meanwhile the <span class="inline_sym">-ot</span> switch will always extract files that differ than the same files in the
target folder, the <span class="inline_sym">-oT</span> switch (uppercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">t</span>') only check the difference of both
files (test operation). No extraction performed in this operation:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world <span class="inline_white">-oT</span> C:\extract</div>

If both files match, a '<span class="inline_sym">===</span>' symbol will be shown, otherwise will showing a '<span class="inline_sym">=/=</span>' symbol
instead. Here an output example:

<div class="quote-code">=== : /def/world/model.sii<br />
=/= : /def/world/overlay.sii<br />
=== : /def/world/road.sii<br />
=/= : /def/world/sign.sii<br />
=== : /def/world/traffic_lane.sii<br />
=/= : /def/world/traffic_rules.sii<br />
=/= : /def/world/traffic_rules_spawn.sui</div>

The <span class="inline_sym">-ox</span> switch allow you to perform update operation to the existing files but also
extract non existing files. This switch is much like a combination of <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> and <span class="inline_sym">-ot</span> switches:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world <span class="inline_white">-ox</span> C:\extract</div>

Sometimes, you want to extract files but keep the existing files in the target folder. For
such purpose, the <span class="inline_sym">-ok</span> switch will always extract files and keep any existing files by
renaming them:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world <span class="inline_white">-ok</span> C:\extract</div>

Existing (older) files will be renamed with date/time suffix. The date/time is taken from
the moment of current extraction has been performed. Here an example:

<div class="quote-code">model___OLD-20220125012300.sii<br />
overlay___OLD-20220125012300.sii<br />
road___OLD-20220125012300.sii<br />
sign___OLD-20220125012300.sii<br />
traffic_lane___OLD-20220125012300.sii<br />
traffic_rules___OLD-20220125012300.sii<br />
traffic_rules_spawn___OLD-20220125012300.sui</div>

The <span class="inline_sym">-oK</span> switch (uppercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">k</span>') has a purpose to update existing files and preserve
the existing one. This <span class="inline_sym">-oK</span> switch has similar purpose to the <span class="inline_sym">-ot</span> switch but also keep
the older existing files by renaming them.
<br />
Let see this example where you want to find changes (test operation) to any file containing '<span class="inline_file">sign</span>'
text in their file name, under "<span class="inline_file">/def/world</span>" path:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world -f *sign* -oT C:\extract</div>

It then gives the following output:

<div class="quote-code">=== : /def/world/sign.base_vehicle.sii<br />
=== : /def/world/sign.custom.sii<br />
=/= : /def/world/sign.sii<br />
=== : /def/world/sign_board_model.sii</br />
=/= : /def/world/sign_stand.sii</div>


To extract only changed files and preserve the existing one in "<span class="inline_file">C:\extract</span>" folder, use
the <span class="inline_sym">-oK</span> switch as follows:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world -f *.sign* <span class="inline_white">-oK</span> C:\extract</div>

It then gives the following output:

<div class="quote-code">=== skip matching: /def/world/sign.base_vehicle.sii<br />
=== skip matching: /def/world/sign.custom.sii<br />
extract: /def/world/sign.sii<br />
=== skip matching: /def/world/sign_board_model.sii</br />
extract: /def/world/sign_stand.sii</div>

The resulting stored files in "<span class="inline_file">C:\extract\def\world</span>" folder should be (as an illustration) like this:

<div class="quote-code">sign.base_vehicle.sii<br />
sign.custom.sii<br />
sign.sii<br />
sign___OLD-20220125012300.sii<br />
sign_board_model.sii</br />
sign_stand.sii<br />
sign_stand___OLD-20220125012300.sii</div>

Please keep in mind, you can't supply multiple <span class="inline_sym">-o</span> switch argument to the command line. In
that case, only the last argument in the command will take place. The following example showing
the argument in white color will applies while others in red are simply ignored:

<div class="code">sxc <span class="inline_red">-o C:\extract</span> def.scs <span class="inline_red">-ot C:\extract</span> -d /def/world <span class="inline_white">-ov C:\extract</span></div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="sizefilter" />
<h3 class="heading-title">File Size Filtering</h3>
Starting from SXC Extractor version 1.19.11.16, you can filter entries based
on uncompressed file size range. The two new <span class="inline_file">-fmin</span> and <span class="inline_file">-fmax</span> switches are
introduced for the purpose. Please note these switches only working with
extract mode on normal operation, but fully working on raw operation through
<span class="inline_sym">-x</span> and <span class="inline_sym">-X</span> switches.
<br /><br />
These switches need a second argument as number of specified size. The
following examples will filter only files with size at least 12,345 bytes,
up to 123,456 bytes, and between 12,345 and 123,456 bytes, respectively:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -o C:\temp -fmin 12345<br />
sxc def.scs -o C:\temp -fmax 123456<br />
sxc def.scs -o C:\temp -fmin 12345 -fmax 123456<br />
sxc base.scs -x -fmin 12345<br />
sxc base.scs -x  -fmax 123456<br />
sxc base.scs -x -fmin 12345 -fmax 123456</div>

Instead of using number in bytes, you can also supply number in kilobytes
and megabytes. Put an appropriate suffix after the number, which is is <span class="inline_sym">k</span> or <span class="inline_sym">kb</span>
for kilobytes and <span class="inline_sym">m</span> or <span class="inline_sym">mb</span> for megabytes.
See the following examples:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -o C:\temp -fmin 10<span class="inline_white">kb</span><br />
sxc def.scs -o C:\temp -fmax 10<span class="inline_white">m</span><br />
sxc def.scs -o C:\temp -fmin 10<span class="inline_white">k</span> -fmax 10<span class="inline_white">mb</span></div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="regexfilter" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Regular Expression Filtering</h3>
Since SXC Extractor version 1.22.9.10, you can use regular expression filtering through the
<span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch. Regular expression must be started with <span class="inline_file">regex:</span>
notation followed by the expression pattern. Take a look at this example:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -f "<span class="inline_white">regex:</span><span class="inline_yellow">^/def/[^/]+\.sii$</span>"</div>

<div class="note">It is highly recommended to <b class="inline_lred">always</b> enclose the regular expression argument with
double-quotes to prevent any character in the pattern to be interpreted as the console pipeline commands.</div>

Regular expression work in <i>line-based</i>&mdash;each full path and file name treated as a line. That's mean,
you are allowed to use the <span class="inline_sym">^</span> (starting position) and <span class="inline_sym">$</span> (ending position) meta-character that will apply to
the scope of full path and file name. From the example command above, the pattern will always
filter any path that starting with <span class="inline_file">/def</span> folder and list files
<i>under that folder only</i>. But now take a look at different case in this example:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs <span class="inline_white">-d /def</span> -f "regex:^<span class="inline_white">/def</span>/[^/]+\.sii$"</div>

You will not get a desired result because you have already set base path to <span class="inline_file">/def</span> folder
through the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> switch, and regular expression pattern expect another <span class="inline_file">def</span> folder inside
the current working folder (which is <span class="inline_file">def</span> folder) where none are meet the criteria in this case.
To fix this scenario, change your regular expression pattern into either these combination:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def -f "regex:<span class="inline_white">[^/]+\.sii$</span>"<br />
sxc def.scs -d /def -f "regex:<span class="inline_white">/</span>[^/]+\.sii$</span>"<br />
sxc def.scs -d /def -f "regex:<span class="inline_white">^</span>[^/]+\.sii$"<br />
sxc def.scs -d /def -f "regex:<span class="inline_white">^/</span>[^/]+\.sii$</span>"</div>

You can also put regular expression in filter definition file. For example:

<div class="quote-code">/def&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regex:^(game|economy|police)_data\.sii$<br />
/def/world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regex:^.*model.*\.sii$</div>

When define filtering in a text file, there's no need to enclose the regular expression syntax
with double-quotes. For more information about filter definition file, please refer to
another topic: <a href="#advancedfilter">Advanced Filtering</a>.

<h3 id="contentfilter" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Content Text Filtering</h3>
Starting SXC Extractor version 1.22.9.10, you are allowed to filter files to be extracted
based on searching of the content text by using the <span class="inline_sym">-s</span> switch. Please note, the usage of the
<span class="inline_sym">-s</span> switch can only be used during <b class="inline_lred">extract</b> mode, otherwise you'll get an error.

<div class="note">Searching text through a file can be a time consuming especially when working with large files.
For such a reason, it is only available during extract mode. Also it is advisable to narrowing
your filters with the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> and/or <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch to minimize the number
of files to be filtered.</div>

The <span class="inline_sym">-s</span> switch is declared in command argument followed by the text to be searched. Take a look
at this example:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world -f *.sii <span class="inline_white">-s</span> <span class="inline_yellow">traffic_light</span> -o C:\extract</div>

This will extract any <span class="inline_file">*.sii</span> files under <span class="inline_file">\def\world</span> folder, where only if these files
containing <span class="inline_file">traffic_light</span> text in their content. It shows the list of files matching the
filter as defined in the <span class="inline_sym">-d</span> and <span class="inline_sym">-f</span> switch, but any file not containing <span class="inline_file">traffic_light</span> text will
be marked as "skip", like the following example:

<div class="quote-code"><span class="inline_red">-!- skip:</span> /def/world/building_model.sii<br />
<span class="inline_red">-!- skip:</span> /def/world/far_model.sii<br />
extract: /def/world/model.sii<br />
<span class="inline_red">-!- skip:</span> /def/world/overlay.sii<br />
<span class="inline_red">-!- skip:</span> /def/world/road.sii<br />
extract: /def/world/semaphore_model.sii<br />
extract: /def/world/semaphore_profile.sii<br />
<span class="inline_red">-!- skip:</span> /def/world/sign.custom.sii<br />
extract: /def/world/sign.sii<br />
<span class="inline_red">-!- skip:</span> /def/world/vegetation.sii</div>

If the search text has spaces, make sure to enclose it with double-quotes:

<div class="code">sxc def.scs -d /def/world -f *.sii -s <span class="inline_white">"</span>traffic light<span class="inline_white">"</span> -o C:\extract</div>

If the search text must includes non-printable characters, you can define them as 8-bits <b class="inline_lred">hexadecimal</b>
notation after a backslash character:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -d /model/traffic_light -f *.pmg -s "<span class="inline_white">\15</span>gmP<span class="inline_white">\07\00\00\00</span>" -o C:\extract</div>

If the search text must contains stand-alone backslash character, they must be defined
twice to make sure the next characters does not treated as hexadecimal symbols:

<div class="code">sxc base.scs -d /ui -f *.sii -s "<span class="inline_white">\\</span>r<span class="inline_white">\\</span>n" -o C:\extract</div>

Please note the search text is case-sensitive and must not less than 4 characters.
Any search text less than 4 characters will be ignored.

<h3 id="modnobase" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Mod File with "No Base Root"</h3>
Starting with SXC Extractor version 1.19.10.4, it has additional
functionalities to handle mod file giving "<span class="inline_file">No Base Root</span>" error message. There
are additional steps when working with such kind of mod files, which will
describe in details below.

<div class="note">Before proceed, it is advisable that you have a little knowledge on binary
file and hex editing. At any particular case, you may need to view binary file
to recognize their type.</div>

For the start, you need to build a hash database file. In order to do that, it
assumed you already accessing (with SXC Extractor) at least 5 default game data
files which is consist of (in alphabetical order):

<div class="quote">base.scs<br />
core.scs<br />
def.scs<br />
effect.scs<br />
locale.scs</div>

Accessing these game data files for the first time will create an associate
index file (<span class="inline_file">*.idx</span>) which is always stored at the same folder where you
put/install SXC Extractor. These index files are required to build the hash
database.
<br /><br />
To create these index file, by assuming you were install the Steam Client
software in the <span class="inline_file">C:</span> drive with default install folder during
installation, you can execute SXC Extractor by supplying each game data file
with their fully qualified path this way:

<div class="code">sxc "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\base.scs"<br />
sxc "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\core.scs" <span class="inline_red">-137243</span><br />
sxc "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\def.scs"<br />
sxc "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\effect.scs"<br />
sxc "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\locale.scs" <span class="inline_red">-137243</span></div>

<div class="note">If you are using SXC Extractor version 1.19.10.19 or later, there's no longer
needed to supply the <span class="inline_sym">-137243</span> switch as shown above.</div>

Execute each line one by one from Windows console. Change the path if the
above example differ than yours. After all lines executed without errors, you
should see 5 associated index file at SXC Extractor folder:

<div class="quote">C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Base.idx<br />
C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Core.idx<br />
C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Def.idx<br />
C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Effect.idx<br />
C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Locale.idx</div>

Please note the name of index file always reflect to the folder location of the
game data file. Yours may differ than they've shown in this example. If that
the case, please change them accordingly to this instruction. These 5 index
files are not mandatory. You may access other <span class="inline_file">*.scs</span> files to create their
associate index file as much as you like. Once our index files are available,
now to proceed with hash database creation procedure.
<br /><br />
To build hash database file, you have to create a text file containing the list
of index file names. By assuming your SXC Extractor is located at <span class="inline_file">C:\sxc</span>
folder, Open Windows Explorer program then expand <span class="inline_sym">My Computer</span> or <span class="inline_sym">My PC</span> and
select <span class="inline_file">sxc</span> folder. From within the folder container panel, right-click to open
context menu then select <span class="inline_sym">New</span> and choose <span class="inline_sym">Text Document</span>. In this example, give a
name to this new text file as <span class="inline_file">dblist.txt</span>. Double-click (or use <span class="inline_sym">Open with</span>
through context menu) to open the newly text file with Windows Notepad
(default) or any pure text editing software. Fill the content of the text file
with the full qualified path of all index files, one line each. With SXC
Extractor stored in <span class="inline_file">C:\sxc</span> folder, the content may look like this:

<div class="code">C:\sxc\C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Core.idx<br />
C:\sxc\C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Locale.idx<br />
C:\sxc\C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Effect.idx<br />
C:\sxc\C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Def.idx<br />
C:\sxc\C-Program-Files-(x86)_Steam_Steamapps_Common_Euro-Truck-Simulator-2_Base.idx</div>

Their order are not important. The above list use number of items ordering from
the least to the most to speed up the build time. Save the file and exit the
text editing software. With this <span class="inline_file">dblist.txt</span> has been created at SXC Extractor
folder, run this command from Windows console to start building hash database
file:

<div class="code">sxc -b C:\sxc\dblist.txt</div>

If done successfully, a hash database file named as <span class="inline_file">sxc.hdb</span> will be created
and stored at the SXC Extractor folder. Once build, now it's time to try
accessing the mod file.
<br /><br />
Let say you have a mod file called <span class="inline_file">stuff.scs</span> located at <span class="inline_file">C:\mod</span> folder, run
this command to show the file list of it's content:

<div class="code">sxc C:\mod\stuff.scs <span class="inline_red">-137243</span></div>

<div class="note">If you are using SXC Extractor version 1.19.10.19 or later, there's no longer
needed to supply the <span class="inline_sym">-137243</span> switch as shown above.</div>

If the mod file previously have associated index file (in this example,
<span class="inline_file">C:\sxc\C-Mod_Stuff.idx</span>), be sure to delete it first prior executing
the command to allow generating a new index file. When the tool done
displaying the list of items, look at the last line about total info and
check if you see a part says "<span class="inline_file"><i>x</i> items missing</span>". If you don't see any,
congratulations, all items on the mod file are completely revealed.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="missingitem" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Working with Missing Items</h3>
The "<span class="inline_file"><i>x</i> items missing</span>" part indicates remaining number of items that not yet
recovered due of their missing file name. Missing file names may be occurs if
they are already hardcoded in the game thus no need to redeclared, i.e.
<span class="inline_file">manifest.sii</span>. Another possible cause is the file name was already defined from
within another file, i.e. <span class="inline_file">description.txt</span> that declared in <span class="inline_file">manifest.sii</span>. If
you facing this problem and want to try recovering most or all of those
missing item's file names, you can try these two approaches.
<br /><br />
The first approach is by looking to the item's file content to examine it's
type. As mentioned earlier, your knowledge to binary and hex editing will
taking part here. You can start by extracting all the file of missing items
by using the <span class="inline_sym">-x</span> switch (lowercase letter '<span class="inline_sym">X</span>'). Based on previous example,
assuming you already have a folder in <span class="inline_file">C:\mod\extract</span> for extracted mod
files, run the following command:

<div class="code">sxc C:\mod\stuff.scs <span class="inline_white">-x</span> -o C:\mod\extract</div>

All missing item's files will be extracted to <span class="inline_file">C:\mod\extract</span> with their own
hash number as file name followed by <span class="inline_file">.DAT</span> extension. You need to examine
these files one by one through hex editing to determine their types. If the
file started with <span class="inline_sym">SiiNunit</span> then it's definitely a <span class="inline_file">.sii</span> definition file. If
started with <span class="inline_sym">material</span> then it's definitely a <span class="inline_file">.mat</span> material file. If started
with <span class="inline_sym">DDS</span> then it's definitely a <span class="inline_file">.dds</span> texture file. If started with <span class="inline_sym">OggS</span> then
it's definitely a <span class="inline_file">.ogg</span> sound file. If the the first couple bytes has <span class="inline_sym">JFIF</span> or
<span class="inline_sym">Exif</span> then it's definitely a <span class="inline_file">.jpg</span> image file. Et cetera. If a file can be
identified, rename the <span class="inline_file">.DAT</span> extention to the appropriate type.

<div class="note">Starting from SXC Extractor version 1.19.11.16, you can supply the <span class="inline_sym">-af</span> switch to allow
the tool to identidy known files for you. Read further under the "File Type
Scanning" section below on how to work with this switch.</div>

Several files can be easily identified. For example, once you can identify a
<span class="inline_file">.sii</span> file and it is definitely <span class="inline_file">manifest.sii</span> file since it is containing
<span class="inline_sym">mod_package</span> text, you can open it up with text editing software and find out
the actual name of icon and description files. Other case may not that simple,
so you need to try the second approach.
<br /><br />
The second approach is by extracting all possible known files (e.g. <span class="inline_file">*.sii</span>
or <span class="inline_file">*.mat</span>) that may contains file name referring to missing items. For
example, the <span class="inline_file">.sii</span> file may contains include file (usually referring as <span class="inline_file">*.sui</span>)
or it's members with declaration referred to <span class="inline_sym">MAT</span>, <span class="inline_sym">PMD</span>, <span class="inline_sym">PMA</span>, etc. The <span class="inline_file">.mat</span>
material file also refer to <span class="inline_file">.tobj</span> file name that may not yet recovered. This
approach may time consuming and need efforts. But if the results are fairly
significant, then it's better than nothing.
<br /><br />
Collect those suspected file names and put them all into a text file, one name
per line. For example, if you able to identify <span class="inline_file">manifest.sii</span> along with the
related files <span class="inline_file">mod_icon.jpg</span> and <span class="inline_file">mod_desc.txt</span>, also additional file name called
<span class="inline_file">/def/vehicle/physics.mymod.sii</span> and <span class="inline_file">/ui/template/mytext.sii</span>, put them together
to a text file like this:

<div class="quote">manifest.sii<br />
mod_icon.jpg<br />
mod_desc.txt<br />
/def/vehicle/physics.mymod.sii<br />
/ui/template/mytext.sii</div>

Save the text file, e.g. <span class="inline_file">namelist_stuff.txt</span> into the SXC Extractor folder and
execute this command:

<div class="code">sxc C:\mod\stuff.scs <span class="inline_white">-bl</span> C:\sxc\namelist_stuff.txt</div>

The <span class="inline_sym">-bl</span> switch will try to resolve the missing items by looking at the name
list. If one or more names in the list are correct, the number of missing
items should decreased or (when all items resolved) no longer displayed at
all. Names that correctly resolved will be displayed at the end of listed
items on screen. You may supply <span class="inline_file">-bl</span> switch multiple times to resolve the
missing items, just make sure to edit and update the list in text file.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="nameresolver" />
<h3 class="heading-title">Name Resolver List, The <span class="inline_file">-bl</span> Switch Usage</h3>
Name resolver list is a collection of possible "missing" paths and file names
where SXC Extractor unable to resolve during index generation. The list are
defined and stored in a single pure text file, defined one entry per line.

<div class="note">The older version of SXC Extractor only support file names (not paths) to be
defined in the name resolver list. The fully support for paths was started
since SXC Extractor version 1.19.10.27.</div>

File name entries may be defined with or without leading path delimiter, for
example:

<div class="code">/def/traffic_data.mod.sii<br />
\material\prefab\mud_road.dds<br />
model/sign/traffic/mod/no_smoking.tobj<br />
sound\environment\spooky_ambient.ogg</div>

Path name entries may be defined with or without leading path delimiter <b class="inline_lred"><u>BUT</u></b>
must supply the trailing path delimiter, for example:

<div class="code">/def/mod<span class="inline_white">/</span><br />
\material\prefab\mod<span class="inline_white">\</span><br />
model/sign/traffic/mod<span class="inline_white">/</span><br />
sound\environment\mod<span class="inline_white">\</span></div>

Although the name resolver list is commonly used to find missing items with
the <span class="inline_sym">-bl</span> switch, you can add the "known working" list to hash database
(<span class="inline_file">sxc.hdb</span>). This way, no need to supply the list to resolve missing items
when frequently working with certain <span class="inline_file">*.scs</span> files. For example, to add name
resolver list stored in <span class="inline_file">list.txt</span> into hash database, the command is:

<div class="code">sxc sxc.hdb -bl list.txt</div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="typescan" />
<h3 class="heading-title">File Type Scanning</h3>
File type scanning introduced in SXC Extractor version 1.19.11.16, with the
main goal to detect file type of missing items and eliminate improper files
indicated as "fake entry". File type scanning work only with <span class="inline_file">*.scs</span> files
formatted as <span class="inline_sym">HashFS</span> (native game data format).

<div class="note">File type scanning work only with <span class="inline_file">*.scs</span> file which has no digital signature.
Mod files those build with <span class="inline_sym">HashFS</span> format are usually not digitally signed.
Because official game data files are mostly digitally signed, file type
scanning will not work with them.</div>

File type scanning work during index generation, or index update through the
<span class="inline_sym">-bl</span> switch. To activate this feature, you can
use <span class="inline_sym">-af</span> switch. For examples:

<div class="code">sxc somemods.scs <span class="inline_white">-af</span><br />
sxc somemods.scs -bl list.txt <span class="inline_white">-af</span></div>

The first example show operation during index generation, where the <span class="inline_file">*.idx</span> file
that associated with input file is not available yet (if it does, delete the
appropriate <span class="inline_file">*.idx</span> file). The second example show operation during index update
with name resolver list supplied through <span class="inline_sym">-bl</span> switch.
<br /><br />
The <span class="inline_sym">-af</span> switch useful only if you encounter missing items. When you perform
list operation of missing items with <span class="inline_sym">-x</span> switch, each entry now will have
their known file type associated with their file extension. Take a look at
this example:

<div class="code">sxc somemods.scs -x<br />
A1B2C2D4E5F678.sii&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.3 kb (comp: 50%, 6.1 kb)<br />
13579BDF02468A.ogg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;678.9 kb<br />
12345678ABCDEF.dds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.6 kb (comp: 97%, 60.2 kb)<br />
ABCDEF12345678.tobj&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5 kb (comp: 95%, 2.2 kb)<br />
123ACB456DEF90.DAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2 Mb</div>

As you can see, instead of showing entries with all <span class="inline_file">.DAT</span> extension as usual,
now by using <span class="inline_sym">-af</span> switch each entry may have their associate file type in their
file extension. However the scanner still can't detect 100% of file types so
some entry may still have their <span class="inline_file">.DAT</span> extension in their name.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 class="heading-title">Epilogue</h3>
SXC Extractor has no relation to the original SCS Extractor and is not
affiliated with SCS Software. SXC Extractor made by user for users. It offers
similar functionality as the predecessor with additional features and
improvements. Since it is useful and proven handy for me (the author), hope it
is also useful and handy for you especially the modders. Have fun, keep
trucking, and happy modding!
